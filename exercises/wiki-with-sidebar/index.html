                        Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989)
                        is an American singer-songwriter. Recognized
                        for her songwriting, musical versatility,
                        artistic reinventions, and influence on the
                        music industry, she is a prominent cultural
                        figure of the 21st century.
                        <br>
                        Swift began professional songwriting at age
                        14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005
                        to become a country singer. She released six
                        studio albums under the label, four of them to
                        country radio, starting with her 2006 self-titled
                        album. Her next, Fearless (2008), explored
                        country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and
                        "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to prominence.
                        Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while
                        Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements
                        and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100
                        number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting
                        Back Together". She departed from her country
                        image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album
                        supported by the chart-topping songs "Shake
                        It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood".
                        Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-flavored
                        Reputation (2017) and its number-one single
                        "Look What You Made Me Do".

                        Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13,
                        1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania. She is
                        named after singer-songwriter James Taylor. 
                        Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former
                        stockbroker for Merrill Lynch and her mother,
                        Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), is a former
                        homemaker who previously worked as a mutual
                        fund marketing executive. Taylor has a younger
                        brother, actor Austin Swift, and is of Scottish,
                        German, and Italian descent. Their maternal
                        grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera
                        singer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree
                        farm that her father had purchased from one of
                        his clients. She is a Christian. She attended
                        preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia
                        Montessori School, a Montessori school run by
                        the Bernadine Franciscan sisters, before
                        transferring to the Wyndcroft School.
                        The family moved to a rented house in the
                        suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,
                        where Swift attended Wyomissing Area
                        Junior/Senior High School. She spent summers
                        in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, until she was 14
                        years old, performing in a local coffee shop.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced
                        Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges,
                        Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and
                        the Warren Brothers and formed a lasting working
                        relationship with Liz Rose. They began meeting
                        for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday
                        afternoon after school. Rose called the sessions
                        "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically,
                        I was just her editor. She'd write about what
                        happened in school that day. She had such a
                        clear vision of what she was trying to say.
                        And she'd come in with the most incredible
                        hooks." Swift became the youngest artist signed
                        by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left
                        then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by
                        Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's
                        lack of care and them "cut[ting] other people's
                        stuff". She was also concerned that development
                        deals can shelve artists and recalled:"I genuinely
                        felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to
                        capture these years of my life on an album while
                        they still represented what I was going through."

                    <p>
                        One of Swift's earliest memories of music
                        is listening to her grandmother, Marjorie
                        Finlay, sing in church.[5] As a child, she
                        enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: "My parents
                        noticed that, once I had run out of words,
                        I would just make up my own."[267] Swift
                        said she owes her confidence and "fascination
                        with writing and storytelling" to her mother,
                        who helped her prepare for class presentations
                        as a child.
                        <br>
                        Swift was drawn to the storytelling aspect
                        of country music, introduced to the genre
                        by "the great female country artists" of
                        the 1990s—Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and
                        the Dixie Chicks. Twain, both as a songwriter
                        and performer, was her biggest musical
                        influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role
                        model, as she would often imitate her. She
                        admired the Chicks' defiant attitude and
                        ability to play their own instruments, and
                        was also influenced by older country stars
                        like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette
                        and Dolly Parton, the last of whom she
                        believes is exemplary to female songwriters.
                        As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by
                        Joni Mitchell's emotional and autobiographical
                        lyrics, highlighting Mitchell's album Blue 
                        s a favorite "because it explores somebody's
                        soul so deeply." She also spoke of
                        influence from 1990s songwriters such as
                        Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan and Alanis
                        Morissette, and alt-country artists like 
                        atty Griffin and Lori McKenna.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Swift is known for venturing into various
                        music genres and undergoing artistic
                        reinventions, having been described as a
                        "music chameleon". She self-identified as
                        a country musician until 2012, when she
                        released her fourth studio album, Red. 
                        Her albums were promoted to country radio,
                        but music critics noted wide-ranging styles
                        of pop and rock. After 2010, they observed
                        that Swift's melodies are rooted in pop music,
                        and the country music elements are limited
                        to instruments such as banjo, mandolin,
                        and fiddle, and her slight twang; some
                        commented that her country music identity
                        was an indicator of her narrative songwriting
                        rather than musical style. Although the
                        Nashville music industry was receptive of
                        Swift's status as a country musician, critics
                        accused her of abandoning her roots in favor
                        of crossover success in the mainstream pop
                        market. Red's eclectic pop, rock, and
                        electronic styles intensified the critical
                        debate, to which Swift responded, "I leave
                        the genre labeling to other people."
