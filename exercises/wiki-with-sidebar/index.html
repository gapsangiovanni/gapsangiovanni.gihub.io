                <p id="Introduction">
                    Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989)
                    is an American singer-songwriter. Recognized
                    for her songwriting, musical versatility,
                    artistic reinventions, and influence on the
                    music industry, she is a prominent cultural
                    figure of the 21st century.
                    <br>
                    Swift began professional songwriting at age
                    14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005
                    to become a country singer. She released six
                    studio albums under the label, four of them to
                    country radio, starting with her 2006 self-titled
                    album. Her next, Fearless (2008), explored
                    country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and
                    "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to prominence.
                    Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while
                    Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements
                    and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100
                    number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting
                    Back Together". She departed from her country
                    image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album
                    supported by the chart-topping songs "Shake
                    It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood".
                    Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-flavored
                    Reputation (2017) and its number-one single
                    "Look What You Made Me Do".
                    <br>
                    Swift shifted to Republic Records in 2018. She
                    released the pop album Lover (2019) and
                    autobiographical documentary Miss Americana
                    (2020), embraced indie folk and alternative
                    rock on 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore,
                    explored chill-out styles on Midnights (2022),
                    and released four re-recorded albums as Taylor's
                    Version following a dispute with Big Machine.
                    The albums and their number-one songs "Cruel
                    Summer", "Cardigan", "Willow", "Anti-Hero" and
                    "All Too Well" broke various records. In 2023,
                    Swift embarked on the Eras Tour and released
                    its accompanying concert film. She has directed
                    music videos and films such as All Too Well:
                    The Short Film (2021).
                    <br>
                    Having sold over 200 million records globally,
                    Swift is one of the best-selling musicians,
                    the most-streamed woman on Spotify, the first
                    billionaire with music as the main source of
                    income, and the only act to have six albums
                    with first-week sales of over one million
                    copies in the US. She has been featured in
                    lists such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest
                    Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest
                    of All Time Artists, the Time 100, and Forbes
                    Celebrity 100. Among her accolades are 12
                    Grammy Awards (including three Album of the
                    Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American
                    Music Awards, 29 Billboard Music Awards, 23 MTV
                    Video Music Awards, three IFPI Global Recording
                    Artist of the Year awards, and 101 Guinness
                    World Records. Honored as Artist of the Decade
                    and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate
                    for artists' rights and women's empowerment.

                <h3>Early life</h3>
                <p>
                    Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13,
                    1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania. She is
                    named after singer-songwriter James Taylor. 
                    Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former
                    stockbroker for Merrill Lynch and her mother,
                    Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), is a former
                    homemaker who previously worked as a mutual
                    fund marketing executive. Taylor has a younger
                    brother, actor Austin Swift, and is of Scottish,
                    German, and Italian descent. Their maternal
                    grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera
                    singer.
                </p>

                    Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree
                    farm that her father had purchased from one of
                    his clients. She is a Christian. She attended
                    preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia
                    Montessori School, a Montessori school run by
                    the Bernadine Franciscan sisters, before
                    transferring to the Wyndcroft School.
                    The family moved to a rented house in the
                    suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,
                    where Swift attended Wyomissing Area
                    Junior/Senior High School. She spent summers
                    in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, until she was 14
                    years old, performing in a local coffee shop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At age nine, Swift became interested in musical
                    theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre
                    Academy productions. She also traveled regularly
                    to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.
                    Swift later shifted her focus toward country
                    music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which
                    made her "want to just run around the block
                    four times and daydream about everything". She
                    spent weekends performing at local festivals
                    and events. After watching a documentary about
                    Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to
                    Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in
                    music. She traveled there with her mother at
                    age eleven to visit record labels and submitted
                    demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks
                    karaoke covers. She was rejected, however,
                    because "everyone in that town wanted to do
                    what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to
                    myself, I need to figure out a way to be different."
