        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can 16 oz. refried</li>
            <li>1 pkg. 8 oz. cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 ½ cup guacamole</li>
            <li>8 oz. grated cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pot 16 oz. mexican sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup cilantro</li>
            <li>1 ripe tomato (chopped)</li>
            <li>1 ½ cup finely chopped lettuce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large plate or mold place the ingredients in
                layers.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Take the cream cheese out of the fridge 20 minutes
                before preparing the Cielito Lindo. Spread the
                refried beans on the bottom of the mold and then
                top with the softened cream cheese. On the cream
                cheese spread the guacamole. Add the lettuce and
                tomato and pour over the pot of Mexican sauce and
                chopped cilantro. Add the cheddar cheese and serve
                at room temperature. You can also bake it at 350F
                for 5-10 minutes or until the cheese melts.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Decorate the Cielito Lindo with cilantro and serve
                it with nachos.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>NOTE:</b> You can serve in glasses or cups to
                serve in small portions. You can add a layer of
                pieces of ripe avocado. You could also make a
                version by adding minced meat and serve warm.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup coconut oil in solid state (not melted)</li>
            <li>½ cup brown sugar or coconut sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup caster sugar/superfine sugar *</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ cup full fat natural Greek yogurt**</li>
            <li>1 cup + 2 tablespoons plain or all purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>
                1/3 cup mini chocolate chips (I used Enjoy Life), divided
                Sea salt flakes
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Using a hand mixer, beat together the oil and
                sugars until combined. Add the egg and vanilla
                and beat until light and fluffy. Mix in the yogurt
                until combined.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Make a well in the centre of your wet mix; add the
                flour, salt, and soda into the centre; mix the dry
                ingredients together first to combine them before
                mixing them through the wet ingredients. Mix until
                just combined (do not over beat) and fold through
                ¼ cup of the chocolate chips. Refrigerate until
                firm (minimum three hours or overnight if you can
                is required for the batter, as it is stickier due
                to the yogurt compared to normal cookie dough).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                When you're ready to bake, preheat oven to 176ºC
                | 350ºF.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Scoop and roll ½ teaspoon of cookie dough PER
                COOKIE into balls and place onto a baking
                tray/sheet lined with baking/parchment paper.
                Press a few more chocolate chips over the tops
                of each cookie with the remaining chocolate chips
                (as many as you want), and bake for 8-10 minutes
                or until cookies are nice and golden in colour.

            <li>¼ cup whole hazelnuts</li>
            <li>1/3 cup nutella , melted</li>

        <h3>Additional for Topping:</h3>

            <li>2 tablespoons (extra) crushed hazelnuts</li>
            <li>6 Ferrero Rochers , halved</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 175c | 350° F. Lightly grease a 9"
                cast iron skillet (or pie dish) with butter/oil, wipe
                over excess and set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Combine the butter and chocolate in your cast iron
                pan/skillet, and melt over low heat. Allow to cool
                slightly and pour the mixture into a heat proof bowl.
                Add the sugar and whisk until light and creamy. Add
                the eggs - one at a time - whisking between each egg,
                until combined.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the flour, cocoa powder and salt, mixing with a
                wooden spoon until just combined. Fold in the crushed
                hazelnuts; pour 1/2 the cookie dough into the prepared
                pan.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Melt the nutella in the microwave for 30 seconds OR
                in a heat-proof dish over a pot of boiling water
                until it reaches a thinner consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the nutella over the cookie dough in the skillet
                evenly to 1-inch of the edges. Sprinkle the wafers
                and whole hazelnuts over the dough. Top with remaining
                cookie dough, smoothing the layer with the back of a
                metal spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes (for a gooey
                cookie). Or for a set cookie, leave it in the oven
                for 10 minutes longer. Cool for about 10 minutes.
                Top with (optional) extra rushed hazelnuts and
                Ferrero Rochers.
            </li>
