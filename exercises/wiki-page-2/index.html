            <b>Graphic design</b> is a
            <a href="#">profession</a>,

            and
            <a href="#">applied art</a>
            whose activity consists in projecting
            <a href="#">visual communications</a>
            intended to transmit specific messages to social
            groups, with specific objectives.

            Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of
            <a href="#">design</a>
            <sup>
                <a href="#">[1]</a>
            </sup>
            and of the
            <a href="#">fine arts</a>. its practice involves
            <a href="#">creativity</a>,
            <a href="#">innovation</a> and
            <a href="#">lateral thinking</a> using manual or
            <a href="#">digital tools</a>, where it is usual to
            use text and graphics to communicate visually.
        </p>
        <p>
            The role of the
            <a href="#">graphic designer</a> in the communication
            process is that of encoder or interpreter of the
            message. They work on the interpretation, ordering,
            and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic
            design uses the
            <a href="#">aesthetics</a> of
            <a href="#">typography</a> and the compositional
            arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to
            convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what
            language alone expresses. The design work can be
            based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up
            being established linguistically, either orally or in
            writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a
            inguistic message into a graphic manifestation.

            Graphic design has, as a field of application, 
            different areas of knowledge focused on any visual
            communication system. For example, it can be applied
            in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied
            in the
            <a href="#">aviation</a> world
            <sup>
                <a href="#">[8]</a>
            </sup>
            or
            <a href="#">space exploration</a>.
            <sup>
                <a href="#">[9]</a>
                <a href="#">[10]</a>
            </sup>
            In this sense, in some countries graphic design is
            related as only associated with the production of
            sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since
            visual communication is a small part of a huge range
            of types and classes where it can be applied.

            With origins in
            <a href="#">Antiquity</a> and the
            <a href="#">Middle Ages</a>,
            <sup>
                <a href="#">[11]</a>
            </sup>
            graphic design as applied art was initially linked to
            the boom of
            <a href="#">rise of printing</a>
            in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of
            consumer culture in the
            <a href="#">Industrial Revolution</a>.
            From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the
            West, closely associated with
            <a href="#">advertising</a>
            in the 19th century
            <sup>
                <a href="#">[12]</a>
            </sup>
            and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the
            20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth
            in information exchange today, the demand for
            experienced designers is greater than ever,
            particularly because of the development of new
            technologies and the need to pay attention to human
            factors beyond the competence of the engineers who
            develop them.

        <p>
        <a href="#">William Addison Dwiggins</a>
        is often credited with first using the term "graphic design"
        in a 1922 article
        <sup>
            <a href="#">[14]</a>
        </sup>
        although it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9,
        number 27) of Organized Labor, a publication of the
        Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about
        technical education for printers:
        <sup>
            <a href="#">[15]</a>

            An Enterprising Trades Union
            <br>
            … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which
            prevails among printers is an assurance that with the
            elemental principles of design at their finger ends
            many of them will grow in knowledge and develop into
            specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
