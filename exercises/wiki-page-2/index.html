            The role of the
            <a href="#">graphic designer</a> in the communication
            process is that of encoder or interpreter of the
            message. They work on the interpretation, ordering,
            and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic
            design uses the
            <a href="#">aesthetics</a> of
            <a href="#">typography</a> and the compositional
            arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to
            convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what
            language alone expresses. The design work can be
            based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up
            being established linguistically, either orally or in
            writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a
            inguistic message into a graphic manifestation.

            Graphic design has, as a field of application, 
            different areas of knowledge focused on any visual
            communication system. For example, it can be applied
            in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied
            in the
            <a href="#">aviation</a> world

            In this sense, in some countries graphic design is
            related as only associated with the production of
            sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since
            visual communication is a small part of a huge range
            of types and classes where it can be applied.

            graphic design as applied art was initially linked to
            the boom of
            <a href="#">rise of printing</a>
            in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of
            consumer culture in the
            <a href="#">Industrial Revolution</a>.
            From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the
            West, closely associated with
            <a href="#">advertising</a>
            in the 19th century

            and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the
            20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth
            in information exchange today, the demand for
            experienced designers is greater than ever,
            particularly because of the development of new
            technologies and the need to pay attention to human
            factors beyond the competence of the engineers who
            develop them.

            From scientific journals to news reporting, the
            presentation of opinion and facts is often improved
            with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual
            information – known as
            <a href="#">information design</a>.
            With the advent of the web, information designers
            with experience in interactive tools are increasingly
            used to illustrate the background to news stories.
            Information design can include Data and
            <a href="#">information visualization</a>,
            which involves using programs to interpret and form
            data into a visually compelling presentation, and can
            be tied in with
            <a href="#">information graphics</a>.

            A graphic design project may involve the creative
            presentation of existing

            ornament, and images.

            The "process school" is concerned with communication;
            it highlights the channels and media through which
            messages are transmitted and by which senders and
            receivers encode and decode these messages. The
            semiotic school treats a message as a construction of
            signs which through interaction with receivers,
            produces meaning; communication as an agent.

                Main article:

            Typography includes type design, modifying type
            <a href="#">glyphs</a>
            and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are
            created and modified using illustration techniques.
            Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point
            size, tracking (the space between all characters used),
            kerning (the space between two specific characters)
            and leading (line spacing).

            Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors,
            typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and
            clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography
            was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts
            communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For
            example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin
            to a typewriter or a vintage report.

            Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements
            (content) on a page, such as image placement, text
            layout and style. Page design has always been a
            consideration in printed material and more recently
            extended to displays such as web pages. Elements
            typically consist of
            <a href="#">type</a>
            (text),
            <a href="#">images</a>
            (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally
            place-holder graphics such as a
            <a href="#">dieline</a>
            for elements that are not printed with ink such as
            <a href="#">die/laser cutting, foil stamping</a> or
            <a href="#">blind embossing</a>.

        <h3>Grids</h3>
        <p>
            A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and
            information, allowing the reader to easily comprehend
            the overall project. Furthermore, a grid functions as
            a container for information and a means of establishing
            and maintaining order. Despite grids being utilized
            for centuries, many graphic designers associate them
            with Swiss design. The desire for order in the 1940s
            resulted in a highly systematic approach to visualizing
            information. However, grids were later regarded as
            tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of
            "designersaur." Today, grids are once again considered
            crucial tools for professionals, whether they are
            novices or veterans.
