                <h2>Hi! my name is Gricel.</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Graphic Designer & Web Developer, born and
                    raise in the Dominican Republic, currently living
                    in Atlanta, Georgia.
                    <br>
                    I've always found a passion on creating things. Back
                    when I was in middle school I was in Art class and
                    one of our final projects was to create an original
                    painting, everyone in my class went for a landscape
                    type of painting, but I wanted something that
                    would challenge me into painting something that
                    would be much more than a sky and mountains or a
                    beach. So I remember my godfather had a photoshoot
                    session of his little dog with funny clothes and
                    I went for it. I created a painting that my teacher
                    was so proud of, and I enjoyed every minute I got to
                    work on it.

                    Hey! I'm no Leonardo da Vinci but my this
                    little dog painting was a work of art for
                    a 10 year old.

                Anyways, the years went by and that hunger for being
                able to create stuff kept being in me. I kept trying
                to learn new stuff, watching Youtube Videos but I
                never really got the chance of work towards my goal
                until I came to live here in the U.S and got the
                chance to enroll into a Graphic Design & Web Development
                class that has taught me so much and helped me
                redefine everything I know.
                <br>
                Now I'm just eager to dive into the Graphic Design
                world and be able to bring my future clients' ideas
                into life!
