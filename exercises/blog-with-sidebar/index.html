                    Recently opened in the busy Insurgentes Sur
                    avenue in Mexico City, the Nacion Sushi cheerful
                    welcomes you to its colorful ambient divided
                    by asiatic Countries as much as it’s divided
                    its menu.
                    I’ve been there twice, once for a dinner with
                    my best friend Brenda and the other one on a
                    quick lunch before heading back to work.
                    Airy, dinamic and friendly, I immediately
                    noticed the young staff and their will to work
                    and attend you the best way they can and the
                    kids area with tablets to entertain children
                    while parents can have a peaceful time.
                    They branded the new Restaurant exactly the
                    way the others Nacion Sushi around the world
                    are branded and I can tell they didn’t hold
                    their money in decoration which is a plus in
                    case of influencers like me, and they also
                    have a working area with tablets for adults
                    to keep on working while you’re eating.
                    They have restaurants in Panama, Mexico, Costa
                    Rica, Colombia, Spain, Guatemala, Paraguay,
                    Dominican Republic and United States.
                    <b>
                        So yes, Sushi does unite the people and
                        nations.
                    </b>
                    The food is good and it’s honest, not like in
                    most of asiatic food chains where they serve
                    you a ball of rice and a micro point of
                    proteins. I highly recommend to order and share
                    the food because it’s enough for everybody to
                    try and taste it.
                    <img
                        src=""

                    That’s another point in my food blogger heart
                    because nothing better than being served your
                    favorite food and it’s abundant. And as I
                    always say, share is care. So share your food
                    with your friends and family and enjoy it.
                    The drinks also are really good, ask your waiter
                    for an advice and they’ll sort out the best
                    juice for you, I tried those honey based and
                    were delicious. Especially the one with pineapple,
                    lemon and coconut.
                    <b>
                        Good thing, they use paper straws. No
                        plastic here and glad to see how the Nacion
                        Sushi is conscious about the environment.
                    </b>
                    But you can count on a large menu of drinks,
                    from coffees, beers (nationals and internationals
                    including the famous Sapporo and then the Kirin
                    Ichiban and Asahi), wines and hard alcohol
                    drinks.
                    They also have some really tasty infusions
                    with Jamaica`s flowers and fruits for those
                    who love hot tea.
                    I recommend this place for large groups, quick
                    lunches or dinners and families as it is plenty
                    of space.
                    <br>
                    If you wanna see more or reserve at the Nacion
                    sushi, though they accept walk ins, here you
                    have their Instagram.
